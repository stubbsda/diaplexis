The Diaplexis library consists of approximately 24,000 lines of C++ code, written with the
goal of exploring the numerical dynamics of a combinatorial spacetime model based on a ramified or
multi-sheeted simplicial complex. Compiling this library requires a modern C++ compiler as well as
the [Synarmosma library](http://www.synarmosma.org/software/synarmosma/). The current package includes both
the standard multi-sheeted version of the library (Polyphyllon) and a simpler but faster version that
assumes the entire spacetime complex exists on a single sheet (Monophyllon). This repository also
includes an older version of the library, in the <code>old</code> directory, which uses a slower and
significantly less robust representation of the ubiquity of the spacetime's _n_-simplices. The Diaplexis
library also depends on various external libraries, which for the most part are also needed to build
the Synarmosma library: the [Boost library](https://www.boost.org), Victor Shoup's [NTL](https://www.shoup.net/ntl) for
number theory, the GNU [multiprecision library](https://www.gmplib.org) and an implementation of LAPACK, needed
for the calculation of the eigenvales of dense matrices. The Diaplexis library also requires the
[PugiXML library](http://www.pugixml.org) for XML processing, used with the parameter and log files, along 
with an installation of [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org) for visualizing the combinatorial topology of the 
spacetime. The Diaplexis library is released under the Gnu Public License version 3.0; see the 
<code>LICENSE.txt</code> file or the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/licensing) for details.

To install the Diaplexis library, enter the directory <code>diaplexis</code> and choose between the
Monophyllon and Polyphyllon versions of the library. After descending into the appropriate directory, the
command <code>make</code> will carry out the build process and <code>sudo make install</code> will
install the Diaplexis library in its default location, <code>/usr/local/diaplexis</code>. If you do
not have root access or do not wish to install the library in a system directory, you can modify the
value of <code>INSTALL_DIR</code> at the beginning of the Makefile to some other directory, such as
<code>$HOME/diaplexis</code>. The compilation of the Diaplexis library has been developed and tested
in a Linux environment (with x86, x86-64 and ARMv6 processor architectures), using both the GNU
and Intel C++ compilers. In principle it should also run under Windows using the Cygwin environment.

Normally the only parameters that a user should need to modify in order to build the Diaplexis library
are located at the beginning of the Makefile, where various compiler arguments and libraries are all
specified. The build variables are all described in the Makefile and in general the default values should
be safe on most Unix-like platforms. A sample program file, <code>euplecton.cpp</code>, illustrating the
use of the Spacetime class is also included in the current directory along with an example of an XML parameter
file, intended for use with the Polyphyllon version of this library. Using the included makefile a simple
test can be run to verify the installation, which writes all its output in the <code>data</code> directory.

The <code>VERBOSE</code> compilation flag causes the Diaplexis library to write a great deal of diagnostic
logging information to the standard output during execution and is normally only useful for developers.
That said, with this flag users can have access to a wealth of information about the library's reasoning
process for the hyphantic operators that are used, information which does not appear in the log file
created by the normal execution of the library. The quantity of output which is generated by this flag
is however sufficiently large that users should redirect the standard output to a disk file for post-execution
study. The source code contains OpenMP directives that are active when a C++ compiler with support for OpenMP
is used for the compilation, assumed to be compatible with the OpenMP 3.1 standard. Both of the branches of
the Diaplexis library are documented using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/), for which there is a configuration
file <code>docs.config</code> in the relevant directory that can be modified as needed.
