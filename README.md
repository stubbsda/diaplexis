The Diaplexis library is roughly 24,000 lines of C++ code written to explore the numerical dynamics 
of a combinatorial spacetime model based on a ramified or multi-sheeted simplicial complex. Compiling 
this library requires a modern C++ compiler as well as the Synarmosma library, also available from 
www.synarmosma.org via the file synarmosma.tar.gz. The current package includes both the standard 
multi-sheeted version of the library (Polyphyllon) and a simpler but faster version that assumes the 
entire spacetime complex exists on a single sheet (Monophyllon). The Diaplexis library also depends 
on various external libraries, which for the most part are also needed to build the Synarmosma library: 
the the Boost library (www.boost.org), Victor Shoup's NTL (www.shoup.net/ntl) for number theory and 
an implementation of LAPACK that's needed for the calculation of eigenvales of dense matrices. The 
Diaplexis library also requires the PugiXML library (www.pugixml.org) for XML processing, used with 
the parameter and log files. The Diaplexis library is released under the Gnu Public License version 
3.0 (see LICENSE.txt or www.fsf.org/licensing for details). 

To install the Diaplexis library, enter the directory <code>diaplexis</code> and choose between the Monophyllon and 
Polyphyllon versions of the library. After descending into the desired directory, the command <code>make</code> 
will carry out the build process and <code>sudo make install</code> will install the Diaplexis library in its 
default location, <code>/usr/local/diaplexis</code>. If you don't have root access or don't wish to install the 
library in a system directory, you can modify the value of <code>INSTALL_DIR</code> at the beginning of the Makefile 
to some other directory, such as <code>$HOME/diaplexis</code>. The compilation of the Diaplexis library has been 
tested on several Unix platforms, including OS X/x86-64, OpenBSD (x86 and x86-64) and Linux (x86, 
x86-64 and ARMv6), using both the Gnu (g++) and Intel (icpc) compilers. In principle it should also 
run under Windows using the Cygwin environment. 

Normally the only parameters that a user should need to modify in order to build the Diaplexis library 
are located at the beginning of the Makefile, where various compiler arguments and libraries are all 
specified. The build variables are all described in the Makefile and in general the default values should 
be safe on most Unix-like platforms. A sample main.cpp file illustrating the use of the Spacetime class 
is also included in the current directory along with an example of a parameter file (intended for the 
Polyphyllon version of the Diaplexis library).

The VERBOSE compilation flag causes the Diaplexis library to write a great deal of diagnostic logging 
information to the standard output during execution and is normally only useful for developers. That 
said, with this flag users can have access to a wealth of information about the library's reasoning 
process for the hyphantic operators that are used, information which does not appear in the log file 
created by the normal execution of the library. The quantity of text generated by this flag is sufficiently 
large however that users should redirect the standard output to a disk file for subsequent analysis. 
The source code contains OpenMP directives that are active when a C++ compiler with support for OpenMP 
is used for the compilation, assumed to be compatible with OpenMP 3.1.
